Project Title:
House Price Prediction

Project Description:
In this project, I applied data science and machine learning techniques to predict house prices using a dataset containing information about housing in a specific area. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

Project Steps:

1.Data Collection:
Utilized a dataset containing 20,640 entries with 10 columns, including attributes like longitude, latitude, housing median age, etc.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values in the 'total_bedrooms' column using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation).
Explored and removed any duplicate data points.
Converted categorical data (e.g., 'ocean_proximity') into numerical format, possibly using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3.Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate the model's performance.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset, including summary statistics, data distribution, and visualizations.
Analyzed the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and the target variable ('median_house_value').

5.Feature Engineering:
Created additional features (e.g., adding two new features) to improve the model's predictive power.

6.Model Building:
Developed a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on the selected features.
Trained the model on the training dataset.

7.Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance using the testing dataset.
